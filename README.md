## Welcome to the Poppy

This app is for all patrons of the Poppy Hotel to manage their `upcoming bookings`, `review their past stays`, `create reservations for new stays`, and `review the total spent at The Poppy`. 

## Inspiration:
I went on a trip to Europe this year and fell in love with not only the beautiful hotels but also their websites! They took something mundane and made the user experience really interesting. I am happy to see the inspiration of those amazing hotels in this app! 

Major inspirations for this project were also from [here](https://www.behance.net/gallery/129135595/The-Moore-Hotel?tracking_source=search_projects%7Chotel), [here](https://www.behance.net/gallery/140900029/Luxury-Hotel-Web-Design?tracking_source=search_projects%7Chotel), and [here](https://www.behance.net/gallery/135480647/The-Royal-Hotel-digital?tracking_source=search_projects%7Chotel). Thank you to those amazing designers!
