## Welcome to the Poppy

This app is for all patrons of the Poppy Hotel to manage their `upcoming bookings`, `review their past stays`, `create reservations for new stays`, and `review the total spent at The Poppy`. 

When a customer visits the app, they will be greated by a landing page with video playing from one of the Poppy's many luxurious events 



# Context:

I am currently a 2208 Mod 2 student at Turing in the frontend program. This is the final solo project of Mod 2. The technologies used for it were `HTML`, `CSS`, and `Javascript`. The project was to create a hotel management tool for hotel customers to manage room bookings.

I went on a trip to Europe this year and fell in love with not only the beautiful hotels but also their websites! They took something mundane and made the user experience really interesting. I am happy to see the inspiration of those amazing hotels in this app! 

Major inspirations for this project were also from [here](https://www.behance.net/gallery/129135595/The-Moore-Hotel?tracking_source=search_projects%7Chotel), [here](https://www.behance.net/gallery/140900029/Luxury-Hotel-Web-Design?tracking_source=search_projects%7Chotel), and [here](https://www.behance.net/gallery/135480647/The-Royal-Hotel-digital?tracking_source=search_projects%7Chotel). Thank you to those amazing designers!

- `Isabel Powers` - shoutout to my best friend for contributing some of the picutres you will see throughout the app as well as the name!

# Learning Goals:

The `Learning Goals` were: 
- Use OOP to drive the design of the application and the code
- Work with an API to send and receive data
- Solidify the code review process
- Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application


# Wins + Challenges:
- A huge `win` for me was getting the app to function for when a customerm selected `multiple dates` and making the `network requests` for each date.
- A big challenge was dates. This app has a lot to do with dates, so much of my time was spent on formatting and transforming dates.
